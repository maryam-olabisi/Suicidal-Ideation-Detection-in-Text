# Suicidal Ideation Detection in Text

The main objectives of this research are to:
● Collect a more recent and diverse dataset.
● Train multi-layered CNN and LSTM+CNN models to detect suicidal ideation in tweets using the Word2Vec word embedding method.
● Train a BERT model to identify suicidal tweets.
● Compare the performance of these modes to one another and to previously used methods.
